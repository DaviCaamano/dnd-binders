### Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll damage for an attack you make with a Melee weapon that you are holding with two hands, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a damage die as a 3. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property to gain this benefit.

### Paladin’s Smite
You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it from this feature once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it this way again.`;

### Channel Divinity
You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.

You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11. If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the Spell Save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.`;

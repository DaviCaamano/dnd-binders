### Action Surge
You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the Magic action.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.

### Tactical Mind
You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn't expended.`;

### Improved Critical
Your attack rolls with weapons and Unarmed Strikes can score a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

### Remarkable Athlete
Thanks to your athleticism, you have Advantage on Initiative rolls and Strength (Athletics) checks.

In addition, immediately after you score a Critical Hit, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.`;

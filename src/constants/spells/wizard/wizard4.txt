#### Magic Jar
*Level 6 Necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gem, crystal, or reliquary worth 500+ GP)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled
---
Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell's Material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container's space. You can't move or take Reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a Humanoid's body.

You can attempt to possess any Humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a *Protection from Evil and Good* or *Magic Circle* spell can't be possessed). The target makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul enters the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a successful save, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Speed, and senses are replaced by the creature's. You otherwise keep your game statistics.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move and it is Incapacitated.

While possessing a body, you can take a Magic action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.

When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

**Classes:** Wizard






#### Magic Missile
*Level 1 Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart strikes a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 Force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The spell creates one more dart for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Magic Mouth
*Level 2 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (jade dust worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled
---
You implant a message within an object in range—a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.

When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there, so the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

**Classes:** Artificer, Bard, Wizard

#### Magic Weapon
*Level 2 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls. The spell ends early if you cast it again.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The bonus increases to +2 with a level 3-5 spell slot. The bonus increases to +3 with a level 6+ spell slot.

**Classes:** Artificer, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Major Image
*Level 3 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can't deal damage or cause conditions.

If you are within range of the illusion, you can take a Magic action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring Concentration, if cast with a level 4+ spell slot.

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

#### Mass Polymorph
*Level 9 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist the transformation. An unwilling shapechanger automatically succeeds on the save.

Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different ones for each target. The new form can be any beast you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or half the target's level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.

Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary hit points can't be replaced by temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form. It can't speak, cast spells, or do anything else that requires hands or speech.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

**Classes:** Bard, Bard, Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Wizard, Wizard






#### Mass Suggestion
*Level 6 Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a snake's tongue)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
You suggest a course of activity—described in no more than 25 words—to twelve or fewer creatures you can see within range that can hear and understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would obviously deal damage to any of the targets or their allies. For example, you could say, "Walk to the village down that road, and help the villagers there harvest crops until sunset." Or you could say, "Now is not the time for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop in an hour."

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target. Each Charmed target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends for a target upon completing it.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The duration is longer with a spell slot of level 7 (10 days), 8 (30 days), or 9 (366 days).

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Maximilian's Earthen Grasp
*Level 2 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature hand sculpted from clay)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spell's duration.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Wizard, Wizard

#### Maze
*Level 8 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can take a Study action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

**Classes:** Wizard

#### Melf's Acid Arrow
*Level 2 Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 Acid damage and 2d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage only.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes:** Wizard

#### Melf's Minute Meteors
*Level 3 Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell—and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Wizard, Wizard

#### Mending
*Transmutation Cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can't restore magic to such an object.

**Classes:** Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Mental Prison
*Level 6 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell that only it perceives. One creature you can see within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. The target succeeds automatically if it is immune to being charmed. On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target's space appear dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can't see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the spell's duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Warlock, Wizard, Wizard






#### Message
*Transmutation Cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a copper wire)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.

**Classes:** Artificer, Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Meteor Swarm
*Level 9 Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 1 mile
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6 Fire damage and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected only once.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area, and the object starts burning if it's flammable.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Mighty Fortress
*Level 8 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 1 mile
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground of your choice that you can see within range. The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.

The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress's outer wall.

A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.

A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the *unseen servant* spell.

The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM's discretion.

After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.

Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.

**Classes:** Wizard, Wizard

#### Mind Blank
*Level 8 Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has Immunity to Psychic damage and the Charmed condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spell—not even *Wish*—can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.

**Classes:** Bard, Wizard

#### Mind Sliver
*Enchantment Cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You try to temporarily sliver the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 Psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.
***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6).

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

#### Mind Spike
*Level 2 Divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You drive a spike of psionic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you, and if it has the Invisible condition, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard






#### Minor Illusion
*Illusion Cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again.

If a creature takes a Study action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

***Sound.*** If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

***Image.*** If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

#### Mirage Arcane
*Level 7 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Sight
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 days
---
You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other rough or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into Difficult Terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.

Creatures with Truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

**Classes:** Bard, Druid, Wizard

#### Mirror Image
*Level 2 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real.

Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll during the spell's duration, roll a d6 for each of your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight.

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

#### Mislead
*Level 5 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You gain the Invisible condition at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.

As a Magic action, you can move the illusory double up to twice your Speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It is intangible and invulnerable.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is.

**Classes:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard

#### Misty Step
*Level 2 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

#### Modify Memory
*Level 5 Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the target also has the Incapacitated condition and is unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity, change its memory of the event's details, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you finish describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as a false memory of how much the creature enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature.

A *Remove Curse* or *Greater Restoration* spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7 spell slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any time in the creature's past (level 9 spell slot).

**Classes:** Bard, Wizard






#### Mold Earth
*Transmutation Cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)
---
You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't involve enough force to cause damage.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

**Classes:** Druid, Druid, Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Wizard, Wizard

#### Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound
*Level 4 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a silver whistle)
- **Duration:** 8 hours
---
You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hound remains for the duration or until the two of you are more than 300 feet apart from each other.

No one but you can see the hound, and it is intangible and invulnerable. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound has Truesight with a range of 30 feet.

At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one enemy within 5 feet of it. That enemy must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d8 Force damage.

On your later turns, you can take a Magic action to move the hound up to 30 feet.

**Classes:** Artificer, Wizard

#### Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion
*Level 7 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature door worth 15+ GP)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
You conjure a shimmering door in range that lasts for the duration. The door leads to an extradimensional dwelling and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the door remains open. You can open or close it (no action required) if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the door is imperceptible.

Beyond the door is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The dwelling's atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you like for the dwelling, but it can't exceed 50 contiguous 10-foot Cubes. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from it.

A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You determine the appearance of these servants and their attire. They are invulnerable and obey your commands. Each servant can perform tasks that a human could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can't leave the dwelling.

When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the unoccupied spaces nearest to the entrance.

**Classes:** Bard, Wizard

#### Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum
*Level 4 Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a Cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration.

When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any of the following properties:

- Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including Darkvision) through it.
- Sensors created by Divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
- Creatures in the area can't be targeted by Divination spells.
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for 365 days makes the spell last until dispelled.

#### Mordenkainen's Sword
*Level 7 Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature sword worth 250+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a spectral sword that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

On your later turns, you can take a Bonus Action to move the sword up to 30 feet to a spot you can see and repeat the attack against the same target or a different one.

**Classes:** Bard, Wizard






#### Move Earth
*Level 6 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature shovel)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 2 hours
---
Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.

At the end of every 10 minutes you spend Concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect within range.

This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

**Classes:** Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

You fill a 20-foot cube you can see within range with fey and draconic magic. Roll on the Mischievous Surge table to determine the magical effect produced, and roll again at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. You can move the cube up to 10 feet before you roll.

|  1  | The smell of apple pie fills the air, and each creature in the cube must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you until the start of your next turn.                                              |
|  2  | Bouquets of flowers appear all around, and each creature in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the start of your next turn as the flowers spray water in their faces.           |
|  3  | Each creature in the cube must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or begin giggling until the start of your next turn. A giggling creature is incapacitated and uses all its movement to move in a random direction. |
|  4  | Drops of molasses hover in the cube, making it difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                |

#### Negative Energy Flood
*Level 5 Necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a broken bone and a square of black silk)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a **zombie** at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the **zombie** are in the Monster Manual.

If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn't make a saving throw. Instead, roll 5d12. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.

*Level 2 Illusion*
___

- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
With a touch, you place an illusion on a willing creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried. A creature gains the Mask effect below, and an object gains the False Aura effect below. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast the spell on the same target every day for 30 days, the illusion lasts until dispelled.

***Mask (Creature).*** Choose a creature type other than the target's actual type. Spells and other magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of the chosen type.

***False Aura (Object).*** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect magical auras, such as *Detect Magic*. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, make a magic item appear nonmagical, or change the object's aura so that it appears to belong to a school of magic you choose.

**Classes:** Wizard

For each target, roll a d8 to determine which colour ray affects it.

|  d8 | Octarine Spray Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  6  | At the start of each of its turns, the affected target uses all its movement to move directly towards the closest creature it can see. Then, the affected target uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the affected target does nothing this turn. At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target. |
|  7  | At the start of each of its turns, the affected target gains one *level of contamination*. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Constitution saving throw.

|  8  | **Special.** The target is struck by an additional ray. Roll again twice. There's no limit to how many additional rays can strike a single creature in this manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### Otiluke's Freezing Sphere
*Level 6 Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature crystal sphere)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A frigid globe streaks from you to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

If the globe strikes a body of water, it freezes the water to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice and have the Restrained condition. A trapped creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC to break free.

You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell's casting. If you do so, a globe about the size of a sling bullet, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as a normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 6.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard






#### Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
*Level 4 Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a glass sphere)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
A shimmering sphere encloses a Large or smaller creature or object within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can take an action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's Speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A *Disintegrate* spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside.

**Classes:** Artificer, Wizard

#### Otto's Irresistible Dance
*Level 6 Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target dances comically until the end of its next turn, during which it must spend all its movement to dance in place.

On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition for the duration. While Charmed, the target dances comically, must use all its movement to dance in place, and has Disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls, and other creatures have Advantage on attack rolls against it. On each of its turns, the target can take an action to collect itself and repeat the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Classes:** Bard, Wizard

#### Passwall
*Level 5 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
A passage appears at a point that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, ceiling, or floor) within range and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening's dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.

When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.

**Classes:** Wizard

#### Phantasmal Force
*Level 2 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli.

The target can take a Study action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with it. For example, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall.

An affected target can even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Phantasmal Killer
*Level 4 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusion of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d10 Psychic damage and has Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the spell ends.

For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a successful save, the spell ends.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes:** Bard, Wizard

#### Phantom Steed
*Level 3 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses the **Riding Horse** stat block, except it has a Speed of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes any damage.

**Classes:** Wizard






#### Planar Binding
*Level 5 Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a jewel worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of the inverted version of the *Magic Circle* spell to trap it while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your commands to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your commands to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your commands completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The duration increases with a spell slot of level 6 (10 days), 7 (30 days), 8 (180 days), and 9 (366 days).

**Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard

#### Plane Shift
*Level 7 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth 250+ GP and attuned to a plane of existence)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination, as determined by the DM.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

#### Poison Spray
*Necromancy Cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You spray toxic mist at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 Poison damage.

#### Polymorph
*Level 4 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You attempt to transform a creature that you can see within range into a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into Beast form for the duration. That form can be any Beast you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level if it doesn't have a Challenge Rating). The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point Dice.

The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the Beast form. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points left.

The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.

**Classes:** Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Power Word Kill
*Level 9 Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You compel one creature you can see within range to die. If the target has 100 Hit Points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, it takes 12d12 Psychic damage.

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

#### Power Word Pain
*Level 7 Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You speak a word of power that causes waves of intense pain to assail one creature you can see within range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to crippling pain. Otherwise, the spell has no effect on it. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being charmed.

While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.

A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Warlock, Wizard, Wizard

#### Power Word Stun
*Level 8 Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 Hit Points or fewer, it has the Stunned condition. Otherwise, its Speed is 0 until the start of your next turn.

The Stunned target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard






#### Prestidigitation
*Transmutation Cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You create a magical effect within range. Choose the effect from the options below. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time.

***Sensory Effect.*** You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.

***Fire Play.*** You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

***Clean or Soil.*** You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.

***Minor Sensation.*** You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.

***Magic Mark.*** You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.

***Minor Creation.*** You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand. It lasts until the end of your next turn. A trinket can deal no damage and has no monetary worth.

**Classes:** Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

#### Prismatic Spray
*Level 7 Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Eight rays of light flash from you in a 60-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll 1d8 to determine which color ray affects it, consulting the Prismatic Rays table.

##### Prismatic Rays
| 1d8 | Ray                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  7  | **Violet.** *Failed Save:* The target has the Blinded condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends.

The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack.

___

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
You create a spectral globe around the head of a willing creature you can see within range. The globe is filled with fresh air that lasts until the spell ends. If the creature has more than one head, the globe of air appears around only one of its heads (which is all the creature needs to avoid suffocation, assuming that all its heads share the same respiratory system).
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create two additional globes of fresh air for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes:** Artificer, Druid, Druid, Ranger, Ranger, Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Wizard, Wizard

#### Alarm
*Level 1 Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)
- **Duration:** 8 hours
---
You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:

- **Audible Alarm.** The alarm produces the sound of a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet of the warded area.
- **Mental Alarm.** You are alerted by a mental ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you're asleep.

**Classes:** Artificer, Ranger, Wizard

#### Alter Self
*Level 2 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options. Its effects last for the duration, during which you can take a Magic action to replace the option you chose with a different one.

***Aquatic Adaptation.*** You sprout gills and grow webs between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

***Change Appearance.*** You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can take a Magic action to change your appearance in this way again.

***Natural Weapons.*** You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to deal damage with that new growth, it deals 1d6 damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike, and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls rather than using Strength.

**Classes:** Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Animate Dead
*Level 3 Necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid within range. The target becomes an Undead creature: a **Skeleton** if you chose bones or a **Zombie** if you chose a corpse.

On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating a new creature.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You animate or reassert control over two additional Undead creatures for each spell slot level above 3. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

**Classes:** Cleric, Wizard

#### Animate Objects
*Level 5 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Objects animate at your command. Choose a number of nonmagical objects within range that aren't being worn or carried, aren't fixed to a surface, and aren't Gargantuan. The maximum number of objects is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; for this number, a Medium or smaller target counts as one object, a Large target counts as two, and a Huge target counts as three.

Each target animates, sprouts legs, and becomes a Construct that uses the **Animated Object** stat block; this creature is under your control until the spell ends or until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each creature you make with this spell is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count and takes its turn immediately after yours.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. When the creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it reverts to its object form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The creature's Slam damage increases by 1d4 (Medium or smaller), 1d6 (Large), or 1d12 (Huge) for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes:** Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Antagonize
*Level 3 Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a playing card depicting a rogue)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You whisper magical words that antagonize one creature of your choice within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d4 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see. If the target can't make this attack (for example, because there is no one within its reach or because its reaction is unavailable), the target instead has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Antimagic Field
*Level 8 Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot emanation)
- **Components:** V, S, M (iron filings)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
An aura of antimagic surrounds you in 10-foot Emanation. No one can cast spells, take Magic actions, or create other magical effects inside the aura, and those things can't target or otherwise affect anything inside it. Magical properties of magic items don't work inside the aura or on anything inside it.

Areas of effect created by spells or other magic can't extend into the aura, and no one can teleport into or out of it or use planar travel there. Portals close temporarily while in the aura.

Ongoing spells, except those cast by an Artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the area. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

*Dispel Magic* has no effect on the aura, and the auras created by different *Antimagic Field* spells don't nullify each other.

**Classes:** Cleric, Wizard

#### Antipathy/Sympathy
*Level 8 Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a mix of vinegar and honey)
- **Duration:** 10 days
---
As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that save:

- **Antipathy.** The creature has the Frightened condition. The Frightened creature must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from the target, moving by the safest route.
- **Sympathy.** The creature has the Charmed condition. The Charmed creature must use its movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the target, moving by the safest route. If the creature is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can't willingly move away. If the target damages the Charmed creature, that creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

***Ending the Effect.*** If the Frightened or Charmed creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.

**Classes:** Bard, Druid, Wizard

#### Arcane Eye
*Level 4 Divination*
___

- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)

You create an Invisible, invulnerable eye within range that hovers for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which can see in every direction. It also has Darkvision with a range of 30 feet.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

**Classes:** Artificer, Wizard

#### Arcane Gate
*Level 6 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 500 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You create linked teleportation portals. Choose two Large, unoccupied spaces on the ground that you can see, one space within range and the other one within 10 feet of you. A circular portal opens in each of those spaces and remains for the duration.

The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist that blocks sight. They hover inches from the ground and are perpendicular to it.

A portal is open on only one side (you choose which). Anything entering the open side of a portal exits from the open side of the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other. As a Bonus Action, you can change the facing of the open sides.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

#### Arcane Lock
*Level 2 Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action

- **Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled
---
You touch a closed door, window, gate, container, or hatch and magically lock it for the duration. This lock can't be unlocked by any nonmagical means. You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open and close the object despite the lock. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, unlocks it for 1 minute.

**Classes:** Artificer, Wizard

#### Arcane Vigor
*Level 2 Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You tap into your life force to heal yourself. Roll one or two of your unexpended Hit Point Dice, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll's total plus your spellcasting ability modifier. Those dice are then expended.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The number of unexpended Hit Dice you can roll increases by one for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Ashardalon's Stride
*Level 3 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
The billowing flames of a dragon blast from your feet, granting you explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 20 feet and moving doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

When you move within 5 feet of a creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried, it takes 1d6 fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or object can take this damage only once during a turn.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase your speed by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 3rd. The spell deals an additional 1d6 fire damage for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes:** Artificer, Ranger, Ranger, Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Wizard, Wizard

#### Astral Projection
*Level 9 Necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (for each of the spell's targets, one jacinth worth 1,000+ GP and one silver bar worth 100+ GP, all of which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled
---
You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already on that plane). Each target's body is left behind in a state of suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condition, doesn't need food or air, and doesn't age.

A target's astral form resembles its body in almost every way, replicating its game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view after 1 foot. If the cord is cut—which happens only when an effect states that it does so—the target's body and astral form both die.

A target's astral form can travel through the Astral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that plane, the target's body and possessions travel along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter its body on the new plane.

Any damage or other effects that apply to an astral form have no effect on the target's body and vice versa. If a target's body or astral form drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to dismiss it.

When the spell ends for a target who isn't dead, the target reappears in its body and exits the state of suspended animation.

**Classes:** Cleric, Warlock, Wizard

#### Augury

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses the omen from the Omens table.

##### Omens
| Omen         | For Results That Will Be... |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Weal         | Good                        |
| Woe          | Bad                         |
| Weal and woe | Good and bad                |
| Indifference | Neither good nor bad        |

The spell doesn't account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change the results.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

**Classes:** Cleric, Druid, Wizard

#### Banishment

___

One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the Incapacitated condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (DM's choice) associated with its creature type.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes:** Cleric, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

**Classes:** Bard, Druid, Warlock, Wizard

- Choose one ability. The target has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.
- The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge action on that turn.
- If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** If you cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain Concentration on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require Concentration, and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5-6 slot) or 24 hours (level 7-8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled.

**Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Wizard

___
- **Casting Time:** Action

- **Components:** V, S, M (an eggshell and a glove)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a Large hand of shimmering magical energy in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and Hit Points equal to your Hit Point maximum. If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends. The hand doesn't occupy its space.

When you cast the spell and as a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects:

- **Clenched Fist.** The hand strikes a target within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 Force damage.

The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or the target has the Grappled condition, with an escape DC equal to your spell save DC.

When you cast this spell, you can make up to two melee spell attacks with the blade, each one against a creature, loose object, or structure within 5 feet of the blade. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage. This attack scores a critical hit if the number on the d20 is 18 or higher. On a critical hit, the blade deals an extra 8d12 force damage (for a total of 12d12 force damage).

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and then make up to two melee spell attacks with it again.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can perceive the plane you left, which is cast in shades of gray, but you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can affect and be affected only by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane, and creatures on the other plane can't perceive you unless they have a special ability that lets them perceive things on the Ethereal Plane.

You return to the other plane at the start of your next turn and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane.

This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).

When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.

If a target remains unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.

If the original creature dies after the clone finishes forming, the creature's soul transfers to the clone if the soul is free and willing to return.

Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or that target can't take Bonus Actions or Reactions and must roll 1d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn, consulting the table below.

| 1d10 | Behavior for the Turn                                                                                                                                                          |
|:----:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1  | The target doesn't take an action, and it uses all its movement to move. Roll 1d4 for the direction: **1**, north; **2**, east; **3**, south; or **4**, west.                  |
|  2-6 | The target doesn't move or take actions.                                                                                                                                       |

| 9-10 | The target chooses its behavior.                                                                                                                                               |

- **Components:** V, S

---
You conjure a Large, intangible spirit from the Elemental Planes that appears in an unoccupied space within range. Choose the spirit's element, which determines its damage type: air (Lightning), earth (Thunder), fire (Fire), or water (Cold). The spirit lasts for the duration.

Whenever a creature you can see enters the spirit's space or starts its turn within 5 feet of the spirit, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw if the spirit has no creature Restrained. On failed save, the target takes 8d8 damage of the spirit's type, and the target has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. At the start of each of its turns, the Restrained target repeats the save. On a failed save, the target takes 4d8 damage of the spirit's type. On a successful save, the target isn't Restrained by the spirit.

In addition, the ground in the Emanation is Difficult Terrain for your enemies.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 2d8 for each spell slot level above 4.

#### Contact Other Plane
*Level 5 Divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other knowledgeable entity from another plane. Contacting this otherworldly intelligence can break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.

On a failed save, you take 6d6 Psychic damage and have the Incapacitated condition until you finish a Long Rest. A *Greater Restoration* spell cast on you ends this effect.

**Classes:** Warlock, Wizard

#### Contingency
*Level 6 Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gem-encrusted statuette of yourself worth 1,500+ GP)
- **Duration:** 10 days
---
Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting Contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, a Contingency cast with *Water Breathing* might stipulate that Water Breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then Contingency ends.

The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one Contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another Contingency spell on you ends. Also, Contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

**Classes:** Wizard

#### Continual Flame
*Level 2 Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled
---
A flame springs from an object that you touch. The effect casts Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. It looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and consumes no fuel. The flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.

**Classes:** Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Wizard

#### Control Flames
*Transmutation Cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)
---
You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:

- You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.
- You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.
- You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.
- You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

**Classes:** Druid, Druid, Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Wizard, Wizard

#### Control Water
*Level 4 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a mixture of water and dust)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
Until the spell ends, you control any water inside an area you choose that is a Cube up to 100 feet on a side, using one of the following effects. As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

***Part Water.*** You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

***Whirlpool.*** You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature can swim away from the whirlpool only if it first takes an action to pull away and succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.


#### Control Weather
*Level 8 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self (5-mile radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours
---
You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell, and it ends early if you go indoors.

When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.

##### Precipitation
| Stage | Condition                                  |

#### Control Winds
*Level 5 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you've halted.

***Gusts.*** A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.

***Downdraft.*** You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

***Updraft.*** You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The creature makes a Constitution saving throw.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

#### Create Bonfire
*Conjuration Cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the bonfire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (clay, ash, and mandrake root, all of which the spell consumes, and a jewel-encrusted dagger worth at least 1,000 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
While speaking an intricate incantation, you cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking 2d4 piercing damage that can't be reduced in any way. You then drip your blood on the spell's other components and touch them, transforming them into a special construct called a **homunculus**.

The statistics of the **homunculus** are in the Monster Manual. It is your faithful companion, and it dies if you die. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculus's hit point maximum and current hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point, and the change to your and the homunculus's hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit point maximum can't be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus's death.

You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small Humanoids within range. Each one becomes a **Ghoul** under your control (see the *Monster Manual* for its stat block).

As a Bonus Action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to them). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular place. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow the order until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating new ones.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** If you use a level 7 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four **Ghouls**. If you use a level 8 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five **Ghouls** or two **Ghasts** or **Wights**. If you use a level 9 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six **Ghouls**, three **Ghasts** or **Wights**, or two **Mummies**. See the *Monster Manual* for these stat blocks.

**Classes:** Cleric, Warlock, Wizard

#### Creation
*Level 5 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a paintbrush)
- **Duration:** Special
---
You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create an object within range. It is either an object of vegetable matter (soft goods, rope, wood, and the like) or mineral matter (stone, crystal, metal, and the like). The object must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen.

The spell's duration depends on the object's material, as shown in the Materials table. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. Using any object created by this spell as another spell's Material component causes the other spell to fail.

##### Materials
| Material              | Duration   |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Vegetable matter      | 24 hours   |
| Stone or crystal      | 12 hours   |
| Precious metals       | 1 hour     |
| Gems                  | 10 minutes |
| Adamantine or mithral | 1 minute   |
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The Cube increases by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes:** Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard

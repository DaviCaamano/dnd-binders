### Feat: Great Weapon Fighting

#### Heavy Weapon Mastery
 
When you hit a creature with a weapon that has the Heavy property as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target. The extra damage equals your Proficiency Bonus.

#### Hew

Immediately after you score a Critical Hit with a Melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with one, you can make one attack with the same weapon as a Bonus Action.

### Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Faithful Steed

You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the Find Steed spell prepared. You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.`;

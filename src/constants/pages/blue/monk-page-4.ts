### Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Stunning Strikes

Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk Weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can spend 1 Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target's Speed is halved until the start of your next turn and the next attack roll made against the target before then has Advantage.`;

#### Silent Image
*Level 1 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

As a Magic action, you can cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the Unconscious condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell's effect.

Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, or that have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Snare
*Level 1 Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S, M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 8 hours
---
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.

A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.

After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it.

**Classes:** Artificer, Druid, Druid, Ranger, Ranger, Wizard, Wizard

A stream of acid emanates from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell's duration or until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid takes 2d4 acid damage at start of each of its turns.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.

- **Components:** V, S, M (a tart and a feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
One creature of your choice that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has the Prone and Incapacitated conditions for the duration. During that time, it laughs uncontrollably if it's capable of laughter, and it can't end the Prone condition on itself.

At the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, it makes another Wisdom saving throw. The target has Advantage on the save if the save is triggered by damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level about 1.

#### Tenser's Floating Disk
*Level 1 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action or Ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.

The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

**Classes:** Wizard

#### Thunderwave

___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S

In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the Cube are pushed 10 feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes:** Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

---
This spell creates an Invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 Hit Point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

**Classes:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard

- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
You create a spectral globe around the head of a willing creature you can see within range. The globe is filled with fresh air that lasts until the spell ends. If the creature has more than one head, the globe of air appears around only one of its heads (which is all the creature needs to avoid suffocation, assuming that all its heads share the same respiratory system).
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create two additional globes of fresh air for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes:** Artificer, Druid, Druid, Ranger, Ranger, Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Wizard, Wizard

You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options. Its effects last for the duration, during which you can take a Magic action to replace the option you chose with a different one.

***Aquatic Adaptation.*** You sprout gills and grow webs between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

***Change Appearance.*** You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can take a Magic action to change your appearance in this way again.

***Natural Weapons.*** You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to deal damage with that new growth, it deals 1d6 damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike, and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls rather than using Strength.

For the duration, magical Darkness spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. Darkvision can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the Darkness to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the Darkness.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of Bright Light or Dim Light created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You activate one of the effects below. Until the spell ends, you can activate either effect as a Magic action on your later turns.

***Sense Thoughts.*** You sense the presence of thoughts within 30 feet of yourself that belong to creatures that know languages or are telepathic. You don't read the thoughts, but you know that a thinking creature is present.

The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.

***Read Thoughts.*** Target one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself or one creature within 30 feet of yourself that you detected with the Sense Thoughts option. You learn what is most on the target's mind right now. If the target doesn't know any languages and isn't telepathic, you learn nothing.

As a Magic action on your next turn, you can try to probe deeper into the target's mind. If you probe deeper, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you discern the target's reasoning, emotions, and something that looms large in its mind (such as a worry, love, or hate). On a successful save, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and until you shift your attention away from the target's mind, the target can take an action on its turn to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC, ending the spell on a success.

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

Choose an unoccupied 5-foot cube of air that you can see within range. An elemental force that resembles a dust devil appears in the cube and lasts for the spell's duration.

Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the dust devil must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dust devil. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or light gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud heavily obscures its area.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

For the duration, the spell enlarges or reduces a creature or an object you can see within range (see the chosen effect below). A targeted object must be neither worn nor carried. If the target is an unwilling creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect.

Everything that a targeted creature is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item it drops returns to normal size at once. A thrown weapon or piece of ammunition returns to normal size immediately after it hits or misses a target.

***Enlarge.*** The target's size increases by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. The target also has Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its enlarged weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.

***Reduce.*** The target's size decreases by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. The target also has Disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its reduced weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal 1d4 less damage on a hit (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

As a Bonus Action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet, rolling it along the ground. If you move the sphere into a creature's space, that creature makes the save against the sphere, and the sphere stops moving for the turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. Flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried start burning if touched by the sphere, and it sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.

A creature that ends its turn in the Line must make the same save.

Any creature in the Line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.

The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.

As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can change the direction in which the Line blasts from you.

#### Knock
*Level 2 Transmutation*
___

- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If the target is held shut by *Arcane Lock*, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and closed.

- **Components:** V, S, M (a metal spring)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically up to 20 feet and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate an object that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can take a Magic action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

**Classes:** Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Locate Object
*Level 2 Divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a forked twig)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object's location if that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a specific object known to you if you have seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.

This spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead blocks a direct path between you and the object.

**Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Wizard

#### Magic Mouth
*Level 2 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (jade dust worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled
---
You implant a message within an object in range—a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.

When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there, so the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

**Classes:** Artificer, Bard, Wizard

#### Magic Weapon
*Level 2 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Bonus action

You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls. The spell ends early if you cast it again.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The bonus increases to +2 with a level 3-5 spell slot. The bonus increases to +3 with a level 6+ spell slot.

**Classes:** Artificer, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Maximilian's Earthen Grasp
*Level 2 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature hand sculpted from clay)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spell's duration.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Wizard, Wizard

#### Melf's Acid Arrow
*Level 2 Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 Acid damage and 2d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage only.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes:** Wizard

#### Mind Spike
*Level 2 Divination*

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You drive a spike of psionic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you, and if it has the Invisible condition, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

#### Mirror Image
*Level 2 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real.

Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll during the spell's duration, roll a d6 for each of your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight.

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You fill a 20-foot cube you can see within range with fey and draconic magic. Roll on the Mischievous Surge table to determine the magical effect produced, and roll again at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. You can move the cube up to 10 feet before you roll.

##### Mischievous Surge
|  d4 | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | The smell of apple pie fills the air, and each creature in the cube must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you until the start of your next turn.                                              |
|  2  | Bouquets of flowers appear all around, and each creature in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the start of your next turn as the flowers spray water in their faces.           |
|  3  | Each creature in the cube must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or begin giggling until the start of your next turn. A giggling creature is incapacitated and uses all its movement to move in a random direction. |
|  4  | Drops of molasses hover in the cube, making it difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                |

#### Nystul's Magic Aura
*Level 2 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
With a touch, you place an illusion on a willing creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried. A creature gains the Mask effect below, and an object gains the False Aura effect below. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast the spell on the same target every day for 30 days, the illusion lasts until dispelled.

***Mask (Creature).*** Choose a creature type other than the target's actual type. Spells and other magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of the chosen type.

***False Aura (Object).*** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect magical auras, such as *Detect Magic*. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, make a magic item appear nonmagical, or change the object's aura so that it appears to belong to a school of magic you choose.

**Classes:** Wizard

# Changeling Features

### Creature Type
You are a Fey.

### Shape Changer
As an action, you change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height between Medium and Small. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of an individual you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait.

You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.`;

    * Initiative Proficiency:  When you roll Initiative, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to the roll.
    * Initiative Swap: Immediately after you roll Initiative, you can swap your Initiative with the Initiative of one willing ally in the same combat. You canâ€™t make this swap if you or the ally is Incapacitated.`;

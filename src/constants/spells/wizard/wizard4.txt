#### Speak with Dead
*Level 3 Necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
---
You grant the semblance of life to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer questions you pose. The corpse must have a mouth, and this spell fails if the deceased creature was Undead when it died. The spell also fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the past 10 days.

Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are antagonistic toward it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.

**Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Wizard

#### Spirit Shroud
*Level 3 Necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** Bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You call forth spirits of the dead, which flit around you for the spell's duration. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable.

Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals 1d8 extra damage when you hit a creature within 10 feet of you. This damage is radiant, necrotic, or cold (your choice when you cast the spell). Any creature that takes this damage can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

In addition, any creature of your choice that you can see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.

#### Stinking Cloud
*Level 3 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is Heavily Obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by *Gust of Wind*) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the Sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition until the end of the current turn. While Poisoned in this way, the creature can't take an action or a Bonus Action.

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Summon Fey
*Level 3 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded flower worth 300+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You call forth a Fey spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the **Fey Spirit** stat block. When you cast the spell, choose a mood: Fuming, Mirthful, or Tricksy. The creature resembles a Fey creature of your choice marked by the chosen mood, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

**Classes:** Druid, Ranger, Warlock, Wizard

#### --Summon Lesser Demons
*Level 3 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of blood from a humanoid killed within the past 24 hours)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You utter foul words, summoning demons from the chaos of the Abyss. Roll on the following table to determine what appears.

|  d6 | Demons Summoned                               |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | Two demons of challenge rating 1 or lower     |
| 3-4 | Four demons of challenge rating 1/2 or lower  |
| 5-6 | Eight demons of challenge rating 1/4 or lower |

The DM chooses the demons, such as **manes** or **dretches**, and you choose the unoccupied spaces you can see within range where they appear. A summoned demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The demons are hostile to all creatures, including you. Roll initiative for the summoned demons as a group, which has its own turns. The demons pursue and attack the nearest non-demons to the best of their ability.

As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demons can't cross the circle or harm it, and they can't target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th or 7th level, you summon twice as many demons. If you cast it using a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, you summon three times as many demons.

#### Summon Shadowspawn
*Level 3 Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (tears inside a gem worth at least 300 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You call forth a shadowy spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the **Shadow Spirit** stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an emotion: Fury, Despair, or Fear. The creature resembles a misshapen biped marked by the chosen emotion, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

#### Summon Undead
*Level 3 Necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded skull worth 300+ GP)

---
You call forth an Undead spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the **Undead Spirit** stat block. When you cast the spell, choose the creature's form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The spirit resembles an Undead creature with the chosen form, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You teleport yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within range. Immediately after you disappear, a thunderous boom sounds, and each creature within 10 feet of the space you left must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The thunder can be heard from up to 300 feet away.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also teleport one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell, and there must be an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your destination space for the creature to appear in; otherwise, the creature is left behind.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Warlock, Wizard, Wizard

#### Tidal Wave
*Level 3 Conjuration*

- **Casting Time:** Action

You conjure up a wave of water that crashes down on an area within range. The area can be up to 30 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. The water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area and within 30 feet of it, and then it vanishes.

#### Tiny Servant

- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 8 hours
---
You touch one Tiny, nonmagical object that isn't attached to another object or a surface and isn't being carried by another creature. The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the spell ends or the creature drops to 0 hit points. See the **stat block** for its statistics.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.

When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes:** Artificer, Wizard, Wizard

#### Vampiric Touch
*Level 3 Necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain Hit Points equal to half the amount of Necrotic damage dealt.

Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as a Magic action, targeting the same creature or a different one.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 3.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

#### Wall of Sand
*Level 3 Evocation*
___

- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of sand)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You create a wall of swirling sand on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 10 feet thick, and it vanishes when the spell ends. It blocks line of sight but not movement. A creature is blinded while in the wall's space and must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves there.

**Classes:** Wizard, Wizard

#### Wall of Water
*Level 3 Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of water)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You create a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall's space is difficult terrain.

Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot-square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't fill it.

**Classes:** Druid, Druid, Sorcerer, Sorcerer, Wizard, Wizard

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (DM's choice) associated with its creature type.

Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or that target can't take Bonus Actions or Reactions and must roll 1d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn, consulting the table below.

| 1d10 | Behavior for the Turn                                                                                                                                                          |
|:----:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1  | The target doesn't take an action, and it uses all its movement to move. Roll 1d4 for the direction: **1**, north; **2**, east; **3**, south; or **4**, west.                  |
|  2-6 | The target doesn't move or take actions.                                                                                                                                       |
|  7-8 | The target doesn't move, and it takes the Attack action to make one melee attack against a random creature within reach. If none are within reach, the target takes no action. |
| 9-10 | The target chooses its behavior.                                                                                                                                               |

In addition, the ground in the Emanation is Difficult Terrain for your enemies.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 2d8 for each spell slot level above 4.

*Level 4 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a mixture of water and dust)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
Until the spell ends, you control any water inside an area you choose that is a Cube up to 100 feet on a side, using one of the following effects. As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

***Part Water.*** You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

***Whirlpool.*** You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature can swim away from the whirlpool only if it first takes an action to pull away and succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.

You can also teleport one willing creature. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you teleport, and it teleports to a space within 5 feet of your destination space.

If you, the other creature, or both would arrive in a space occupied by a creature or completely filled by one or more objects, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 Force damage, and the teleportation fails.

This spell puts you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask one question about a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply, which might be a short phrase or cryptic rhyme. The spell doesn't account for circumstances that might change the answer, such as the casting of other spells.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

**Classes:** Cleric, Druid, Wizard

Moreover, the target loses any resistance to that damage type until the spell ends.

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that area into Difficult Terrain.

Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage, and it has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.

A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.

**Classes:** Wizard

#### Fabricate
*Level 4 Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, or clothes from flax or wool.

Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot Cube or eight connected 5-foot Cubes) given a sufficient quantity of material. If you're working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a 5-foot Cube). The quality of any fabricated objects is based on the quality of the raw materials.

Creatures and magic items can't be created by this spell. You also can't use it to create items that require a high degree of skill—such as weapons and armor—unless you have proficiency with the type of *Artisan's Tools* used to craft such objects.

**Classes:** Artificer, Wizard

Wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you Resistance to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you Resistance to Fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack roll, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 Fire damage from a warm shield or 2d8 Cold damage from a chill shield.

**Classes:** Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Gate Seal
*Level 4 Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a broken portal key, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
You fortify the fabric of the planes in a 30-foot cube you can see within range. Within that area, portals close and can't be opened for the duration. Spells and other effects that allow planar travel or open portals, such as *gate* or *plane shift*, fail if used to enter or leave the area. The cube is stationary.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled.

#### Hallucinatory Terrain
*Level 4 Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a mushroom)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
You make natural terrain in a 150-foot Cube in range look, sound, and smell like another sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to notice the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature examining the illusion can take the Study action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. If a creature discerns that the terrain is illusory, the creature sees a vague image superimposed on the real terrain.

**Classes:** Bard, Druid, Warlock, Wizard

---
You hide a chest and all its contents on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serve as Material components for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).

While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can take a Magic action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by taking a Magic action to touch the chest and the replica.

After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance at the end of each day that the spell ends. The spell also ends if you cast this spell again or if the Tiny replica chest is destroyed.

If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as under the effects of a *Flesh to Stone* or *Polymorph* spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.

This spell can't locate a creature if any thickness of lead blocks a direct path between you and the creature.

No one but you can see the hound, and it is intangible and invulnerable. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound has Truesight with a range of 30 feet.

At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one enemy within 5 feet of it. That enemy must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d8 Force damage.

You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a Cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration.

When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any of the following properties:

- Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including Darkvision) through it.
- Sensors created by Divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
- Creatures in the area can't be targeted by Divination spells.
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for 365 days makes the spell last until dispelled.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Increase size of the Cube by 100 feet for each spell level above 4.

---
A shimmering sphere encloses a Large or smaller creature or object within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can take an action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's Speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A *Disintegrate* spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the spell ends.

For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a successful save, the spell ends.

You attempt to transform a creature that you can see within range into a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into Beast form for the duration. That form can be any Beast you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level if it doesn't have a Challenge Rating). The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point Dice.

The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the Beast form. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points left.

The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.

Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 radiant damage, and it suffers one level of exhaustion and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being invisible. The light and any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.

The spirit is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count and takes its turn immediately after yours.

The creature resembles an animate statue (you determine the appearance) made of the chosen material, which determines certain details in its stat block.

---
You utter foul words, summoning one demon from the chaos of the Abyss. You choose the demon's type, which must be one of challenge rating 5 or lower, such as a **shadow demon** or a **barlgura**. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and the demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach that has attacked it.

At the end of each of the demon's turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw. The demon has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say its true name. On a failed save, the demon continues to obey you. On a successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of its ability. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it reaches its full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn't disappear for 1d6 rounds if it still has hit points.

As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can't cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 4th.
